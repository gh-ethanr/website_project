This is goig to be the code for my personal website I am going to make. Using the React Framework ! 

# Inspirations 

This obviously did not come to my myself lol. I was heavily inspired by
multiple videos and ideas. With the most influential being Yapsharlene website's
and her design process (I practically copied it step by step lol). 
I really liked her design, it was both professional but at the same time fun. It reminded me of the y2k era style of the internet which is something I highly respect from a design
perspective.

Another huge inspriation was Lain "Ito can't sleep" on Youtube. As she also made a very y2k
era website that inspires me to make my website more fun while still being functional. This
was also the first youtube video that interested me about making websites.

My full inspiration list can be found on my milanote board, which I have a screenshot
of which shares everything that helped make this website my website ! (smile_emoji)
